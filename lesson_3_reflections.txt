Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

It lets you access your work from any computer you may be working on. It lets others 
view, download, and commit to your repository without needing to have access to your
local computer, and it keeps backups in case your workstation crashes and you
lose a lot of information. Disaster recovery!
