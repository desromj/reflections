Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

It lets you access your work from any computer you may be working on. It lets others 
view, download, and commit to your repository without needing to have access to your
local computer, and it keeps backups in case your workstation crashes and you
lose a lot of information. Disaster recovery!

Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If Git pulled changes automatically, that would overwrite any changes you've made but haven't
had the chance to commit. It would constantly cause you to lose work and not be able to recover it.
